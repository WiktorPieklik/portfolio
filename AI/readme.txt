Here are presented simple, but powerful ai algorithms.

-> X is a matrix (in this case mxn size, where m=100, n=2)
-> y is an vector of actual values
-> w_ is an vector of weights, that are used for prediction and optimization problem

Used concepts:
1) Perceptron class (Rossenblat's idea approximation)
2) Adaline class (Adaptive Linear Neurons)
3) AdalineSGD class (Almost same case as Adaline, but this uses stochastic gradient descent)
